# Void Gambit - Space Shooter

**A performance-optimized space shooter demonstrating advanced software engineering practices and real-time system programming**

## What's Built

Void Gambit showcases solid software engineering applied to real-time interactive systems. The project emphasizes clean architecture, performance optimization, and complex system interactions.

**Core Systems:**
- Four-weapon system with intelligent auto-targeting and distinct mechanics
- Component-based player architecture with modular movement, blinking, and weapon systems
- Dynamic stat modification system with JSON-driven configuration
- Multi-state enemy behavior system with performance-optimized movement patterns
- Companion ship system with formation flying and autonomous combat behavior
- Chain laser targeting with dynamic rebuilding and spatial optimization
- Power budget spawning system with variety algorithms and anti-clustering
- Real-time damage feedback and visual effects management

## Architecture Overview

### Core Design Patterns
- **Component Composition** - Player built from specialized subsystems (BlinkSystem, WeaponSystem, PlayerMovement)
- **Signal-Driven Communication** - Loose coupling between game systems via events
- **Service Locator Pattern** - Global managers accessible via scene tree lookup
- **Data-Driven Configuration** - JSON-based items and stats for runtime flexibility

### System Organization
- **No Autoload Singletons** - All managers created and accessed manually through scene tree
- **Modular Components** - Each system handles specific responsibilities with clear interfaces
- **Event-Based Updates** - Systems communicate through signals rather than direct coupling

## Technical Implementation

### Companion Ship System
**Challenge:** Ships that feel intelligent without interfering with player control
**Solution:** Formation flying with autonomous combat behavior
- **Player-relative positioning** maintains formation during movement
- **Multi-state behavior** switches between patrol, combat, and return modes
- **Smart targeting** with spatial optimization and automatic target cleanup
- **Performance optimization** using staggered calculations to maintain framerate

```gdscript
# Target selection with spatial queries limited to nearby enemies
func find_nearest_enemy() -> Node2D:
    var space_state = get_world_2d().direct_space_state
    var query = PhysicsShapeQueryParameters2D.new()
    var results = space_state.intersect_shape(query, 32)  # Limit for performance
```

### Dynamic Spawning System
**Challenge:** Balanced enemy variety without repetitive patterns
**Solution:** Power budget allocation with anti-clustering logic
- **Budget calculation** distributes enemy power across wave duration
- **Variety preference** prevents spawning identical enemy types consecutively  
- **Efficiency optimization** prioritizes exact-fit enemies for budget utilization
- **Controlled overspend** allows tactical budget flexibility within tolerance limits

### Multi-State Enemy Behaviors
**Challenge:** Natural enemy movement without expensive collision avoidance
**Solution:** Individual behavior variation with optimized state transitions
- **Zone-based positioning** with hysteresis buffers prevents oscillation
- **Staggered calculations** spread expensive operations across frames
- **Individual speed variation** (Â±25%) creates natural swarm behavior
- **Behavioral states** dynamically switch between chase, maneuver, retreat, and strafe

### Chain Laser Targeting
**Challenge:** Dynamic laser chains that rebuild when enemies die
**Solution:** Spatial optimization with automatic chain reconstruction
- **Physics-based queries** find chain targets within weapon range
- **Dynamic rebuilding** handles target death without breaking the chain
- **Visual management** updates beam segments in real-time with automatic cleanup
- **Damage optimization** applies continuous damage while maintaining visual effects

### Runtime Stat System
Performance-optimized stat calculation supporting complex modifier stacking:
```gdscript
func get_stat(stat: String) -> float:
    var base = base_stats.get(stat, 0.0)
    var add = additive_mods.get(stat, 0.0)
    var pct = percent_mods.get(stat, 0.0)
    return (base + add) * (1.0 + pct)
```

## Current Game Flow

1. **Main Menu** - Initialize core managers and start new run
2. **Level Play** - Wave-based enemy spawning with auto-targeting weapons
3. **Hangar** - Purchase items and manage loadout between levels
4. **Progression** - Level advancement with increasing difficulty

## JSON Data Configuration

### Item System
```json
{
  "id": "reinforced_plating",
  "name": "Reinforced Plating", 
  "description": "+25 Max HP",
  "rarity": "common",
  "price": 1,
  "category": "stat",
  "stat_modifiers": { "max_hp": 25 }
}
```

### Behavior Effects
Items can spawn custom behavior nodes:
```json
{
  "id": "warp_detonator",
  "category": "behavior", 
  "behavior_scene": "res://scripts/effects/BlinkExplosionEffect.gd"
}
```

## Technical Metrics

- **Target Performance:** 60fps with 50+ concurrent enemies
- **Architecture:** Component-based with manual dependency management  
- **Weapon Capacity:** 6 simultaneous auto-targeting weapon slots
- **Data Format:** JSON configuration with runtime validation

## Performance Engineering

### Real-Time Optimization Techniques
**Challenge:** Maintaining 60fps with 50+ enemies and complex interactions
**Solutions Implemented:**
- **Staggered calculations** spread expensive operations (distance checks, targeting) across multiple frames
- **Spatial query optimization** limits enemy searches to 32 nearest entities instead of checking all
- **Cached distance calculations** store expensive square root operations and reuse results
- **Individual update intervals** give each enemy slightly different timing to prevent simultaneous expensive operations

### Memory Management
- **Automatic cleanup** leverages Godot's node system for proper resource deallocation
- **Signal-based communication** prevents circular references and memory leaks
- **Modular component design** allows systems to be independently loaded/unloaded

### Scalability Considerations
- **Component architecture** supports easy addition of new enemy types and behaviors
- **JSON configuration** allows runtime adjustment of game balance without code changes
- **Modular weapon system** enables rapid prototyping of new weapon mechanics
